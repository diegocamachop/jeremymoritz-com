NOTES:

Code needs PHP 5+ to run.

Before running this you need to make the sessions directory (/war/sessions) and the log file (/war/logs/php.log) to be writeable.

All other configurations can be found in the file /war/init.php.

This script allows for 2-52 players (don't recommend more than 4 though).
